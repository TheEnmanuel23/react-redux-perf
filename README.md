### React + Redux Performance

This repo is for the Performance Engineering with React + Redux talk at React.js Meetup - Buenos Aires.

The goal is to learn to detect performance bottlenecks in an application, and fix them using a set of techniques:

- Minimizing memory footprint by optimizing the render methods

- Memoizing selectors

- Using pure components

- Connecting list items

- Virtualizing React

Each step has been tagged, so you can fast-forward to it replacing TAG_NAME with the tag of the step:

```
git clone --branch TAG_NAME https://github.com/cazala/react-redux-perf.git --depth=1
```
